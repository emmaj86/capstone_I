      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        My names Emma-jane. I am a keen developer with a particular interest in
        web development. I have self taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I
        have also studied some IT and software through The Open University and I
        am currently undertaking the HyperionDev web development bootcamp, which
        is in partnership with Edinburgh university.I really enjoy building
        websites and learning new things, with web development the possibilities
        are endless!

          "I’m enthusiastic about the University of Edinburgh’s partnership with
          HyperionDev because I believe that more people simply have to learn to
          code, and I like the model that HyperionDev has of being able to do
          that with close support from an early stage with practical examples."
